### Sachita Nishal, PhD Student in Computing, Society, and the Murky In-Between

Hi, Iâ€™m Sachita, and I'm a 2nd-year PhD student at Northwestern University's program in [Technology and Social Behaviour](https://tsb.northwestern.edu/). In my research, I'm very interested in studying how algorithms impact our consumption of ðŸŽ¼, ðŸŽž, ðŸ“º, and ðŸ“° media. In my work, I combine methods in machine learning, text-as-data, and network science, with qualitative approaches drawn from the social sciences. Welcome to my GitHub!

I currently work with [Dr. Nick Diakopoulos](http://www.nickdiakopoulos.com) in the [Computational Journalism Lab](https://cj-lab.org), where we design computational tools to empower journalists, and study the impact of such automation on news production and dissemination.

Some of my other projects also involve the study of cultural industries such as music and film, with a focus on how novelty impacts the success and reception of cultural products.
