### Sachita Nishal, PhD Student in Computing, Society, and the Murky In-Between

Hi, Iâ€™m Sachita, and I'm a 2nd-year PhD student at Northwestern University's program in [https://tsb.northwestern.edu/](Technology and Social Behaviour). 

I currently work with [http://www.nickdiakopoulos.com](Dr. Nick Diakopoulos) in the [https://cj-lab.org](Computational Journalism Lab), where we study the impact of algorithms and automation on the news. 

Some of my other projects also involve the study of cultural industries such as music and film, with a focus on how novelty impacts the success and reception of cultural products. In my work, I combine methods in machine learning, text-as-data, and network science with qualitative approaches drawn from the social sciences. Welcome to my GitHub!
