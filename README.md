### Sachita Nishal, PhD Student in Computing, Society, and the Murky In-Between

Hi, I'm Sachita, and I build interactive AI systems to augment human decision-making. I'm a 3rd-year PhD student @ Northwestern Univeristy, in the area of [Computer Science + Communication Studies](https://tsb.northwestern.edu/). I'm advised by [Dr. Nick Diakopoulos](http://www.nickdiakopoulos.com).

I work at the intersection of Human-computer Interaction (HCI), Natural Language Processing, and Intelligent User Interfaces. I build tools to help science journalists discover + understand newsworthy stories from the latest scientific research, to support decision-making about what makes the news.

Some of my other projects also involve the study of cultural industries such as music and film, with a focus on how novelty impacts the success and reception of cultural products. You can reach me through my email: nishal at u dot northwestern dot edu :)
